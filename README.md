Predicting Housing values with K-Nearest Neighbor
-------------------------------------------------

This code borrows heavly from ["Thoughful Machine Learning with Python"](https://www.amazon.com/Thoughtful-Machine-Learning-Python-Test-Driven/dp/1491924136) by Matthew Kirk.

However, the housing dataset is different than used by Kirk.  Thus all data munging was done by me.  The housing data origin is unknown... I obtained it from a freelancer job post on UpWork.
